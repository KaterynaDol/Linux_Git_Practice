# Linux_Git_Practice

This repository contains all my practice work and homework assignments completed during the **Python Backend Developer** course at **IT Career Hub**.

It serves as a **monorepo**, consolidating multiple smaller repositories and exercises into a single, well-organized structure.  
The repository includes both **Linux & Git homeworks** and **in-class practice materials**.
